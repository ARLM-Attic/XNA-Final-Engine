    /// This is a custom structure that pursues two specific objectives.
    /// The first and more obvious is to reduce garbage collector frequency.
    /// If almost all reference type fields are allocated beforehand then few news are need it and so the garbage collector will remain idle during execution.
    /// The second objective is to guarantied memory locality so that the access time could be improved because there will be less cache misses.
    /// Plenty of information is read every frame and in chunks (thanks to the component model) so this feature could be critical.
    /// This structure also offers the possibility of modified directly the data stored (to avoid replication) and add and remove elements in O(1).
    /// Another feature added was the possibility of increment the size of the pool. This operation has O(n) so avoid using it.
    /// 
    /// Important: The .NET runtime environment manages where to allocate new reference fields and we can do much about it. 
    /// However, if we create everything at the beginning when little or no fragmentation exists then it could be possible that the reference data will be together. 
    /// Of course, this could be change or could be not true even at the beginning.
